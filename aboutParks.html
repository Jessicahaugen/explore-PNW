        <h1>Welcome to the PNW</h1>

          " The Pacific Northwest (PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a
          geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific
          Ocean to the west and, loosely, by the Rocky Mountains to the east.
          Though no official boundary exists, the most common conception
          includes the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) and the U.S.
          states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Broader conceptions reach
          north into Southeast Alaska and Yukon, south into northern California,
          and east to the Continental Divide to include Western Montana and
          parts of Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the coastal
          areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of
          definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities
          of the region's history, culture, geography, society, and other
          factors. The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific
          Northwest, and the Northwest Plateau (also commonly known as "the
          Interior" in British Columbia and the Inland Northwest in the United
          States) is the inland region. The term "Pacific Northwest" should not
          be confused with the Northwest Territory (also known as the Great
          Northwest, a historical term in the United States) or the Northwest
          Territories of Canada. The region's largest metropolitan areas are
          Greater Seattle, Washington, with 3.8 million people; Metro Vancouver,
          British Columbia, with 2.5 million people;[4] and Greater Portland,
          Oregon, with 2.7 million people. The culture of the Pacific Northwest
          is influenced by the Canada–United States border, which the United
          States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region's
          inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples. Two sections
          of the border—one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia
          and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British
          Columbia—have left a great impact on the region. According to Canadian
          historian Ken Coates, the border has not merely influenced the Pacific
          Northwest—rather, "the region's history and character have been
          determined by the boundary".
